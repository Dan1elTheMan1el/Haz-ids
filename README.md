## Automatically updating ids.txt from google sheet data

Used for Arturo's AHK script to farm PTCGP God Packs

Friend codes are filtered in our shared spreadsheet, and edits are automatically pushed to `ids.txt` using an app extension I coded.

The AHK script then uses the raw content of `ids.txt` to sync our group.
